			//team[3] = 'Lux';
			//console.log(players, team);
			
			// however what happens when we update that array?

			// now here is the problem!

			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!

			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
			// Note: How to make a copy of an array.

			const team3 = [].concat(players);

			team5[3] = 'changed';

			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
			const person = {
				name: 'Bobberson',
				age: 80
			};

			// with Objects

			// and think we make a copy:
			const captain = person;
			//captain.age = 99;
			//console.log(person, captain);
			
			// how do we take a copy instead?
			const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99});

			console.log('cap2: ', cap2);

			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
			//Note: Not in the JavaScript language .. yet
			//const cap3 = {...person};
			//console.log(cap3);

			// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
